- Hi, I’m Anthony Falotico (He/Him).  I'm a Data Analytics Engineer at IBM, working on the Client Segmentation and Quota team in the Global Sales Incentives department.
- I work mostly with client data, sales data, and seller data.
- I work a lot with SQL and Python, and occasionally with VBA in Excel.
- I'm interested in data analytics, because I enjoy turning data into easily understood and comprehensive insights for stakeholders and decision makers.
- I’m currently learning as much as I can about PySpark to begin working with larger scale data in a distributed environment. I hope to have new PySpark projects here soon, in my Python repository!
